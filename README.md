# Logical Operators

Logical operators are often a difficult concept for students at the 102 level to grasp. Especially since we don't force the use of logical operators in any of the assignments in the Code 102 curriculum. So it's easy to overlook and/or avoid utilizing these concepts...for now!

The goal of this project is to provide a resource to test a student's comprehension of logical operators and evaluating expressions.
